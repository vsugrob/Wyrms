CameraNotableObject priorities:
	Character	25
	Explosion	60
	Projectile	75
TODO: don't mix notable object and TurnManager attention seeker priorities, these values are from totally different realms.

CameraNotableObject is the component that must be followed by camera
CameraNotableEvent is the component that must be focused by camera for some duration of time.
	It can be implemented as CameraNotableObject with Duration parameter set to non-infinite value.
	Events should have more priority than notable objects.
	Character moved - spawn CameraNotableEvent. Something exploded - again, spawn timed event.
	Object became AttentionTarget of TurnManager - spawn event. Character started turn - spawn event.
	Camera must focus on _closest_ event from the list of events with the same priority.
	Make some duration-based parameter indicating how long events shouldn't be focused after last point in time when camera was scrolled by the user.
	Make parameter
		FocusKind {
			BringIntoView,	// Move camera so that the object is visible by the camera.
			Center			// Make camera centered on the object.
		}
	When time is up, deactivate component instead of destroying it. Re-enabled component must restart its timer.

New priority list:
	Object/Event:			Priority		Timed?
DEL	Camera Pos				0				No						// TODO: priority = 0, timed = no, isn't it the same as no such notable object at all?
DEL	Character				50				No						// TODO: remove Character from priority list. It's neither event nor persistent attention target ("Character Moved" removes the need of constant attention to a character).
	Lost Control			50				Yes
	Bonus Arrived			80				Yes
	Projectile				100				No
	Health Accounted		110				Yes
	Closing Speech			120				Yes
	Explosion				150				Yes
	Character Death			200				Yes
	Received Turn Control	250				Yes						// This event should occur when TurnManager transfers control to a new character.
	Character Moved			300				Yes
	Camera Scrolled			500				Yes
